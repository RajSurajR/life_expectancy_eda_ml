# Life Expectancy Analysis (EDA + ML)

## Overview
This project performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on a real-world
Life Expectancy dataset, followed by a baseline machine learning model.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Feature encoding and preprocessing
- Baseline regression model for prediction

## Result
Built a baseline model to understand factors affecting life expectancy.

## How to Run
Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.
